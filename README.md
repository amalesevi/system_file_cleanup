# system_file_cleanup
 Python Script to clean out my downloads and recycle bin folders

#Getting Started:
Within the directory that you want to store this, you will need to create a paths.yml file and input the directory paths that you would like the script to delete files from into it. This script will loop through those directories, then confirm with you that you want to delete them when it is run.
